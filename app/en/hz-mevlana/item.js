          name are given later. The name Mevlana, which means our master, was
          given to him when he was younger, when he started lecturing in Konya.
          This name was used by those who loved Mevlana as of Sultan Veled
          Şemseddin-i Tebrizi and , and became a symbol instead of his name.
          Rumi means Anatolia. The fact that Mevlana is known as Rumi is that he
          lived in Konya, the province of the Anatolian country called Diyar-ı
          Rum in the past centuries, for a long time, his life was spent there
          and his tomb was also there.`,

        the Turkish princess from the dynasty of the kharzem shah state (1157
        East Turkish Khanate), Melike-i Cihan Emetullah Sultan. Mevlana's Father
        is Muhammed Bahaeddin Veled, known for the title of Sultanü'l-Ulema
        (Sultan of Scholars). Mevlana's grandfather is Hüseyin Hatibi, son of
        Ahmet Hatibi. According to Eflaki, Hüseyin Hatibi was a vast and wide
        scholar of science. A person like Nishaburian Raziyüddin, who was the
        master of the science of religion and one of the great scholars and sang
        beautiful poems, was among his students. It is stated in the sources
        that the mother of the descendant of Sultan-Ulema Bahaeddin Veled
        reached Hz Huseyin, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh) in the
        fourteenth generation. Sources state that Mevlana's ancestry from his

    text: "The Personality of His Father Bahaeddin Veled",
    page: `Mevlana's father, Bahaeddin Veled, was born in 1150 in Belh. Bahaeddin
        was raised with the spiritual knowledge of his father and grandfather.
        He also took lessons from Necmeddin-i Kübra (? - 1221). Bahaeddin Veled
        was a mature sultan, unequaled in all sciences. Bahaeddin Veled, like an
        immense sea consisting of divine truths and Divine sciences, answered
        the most difficult questions of the Khorasan Realm. He was the only
        scholar on this subject. And he wouldn't take anything from the
        foundation. He would make a living from the state treasury with the
        salary allocated to him. According to the narration of the sources, the
        scholars of his time, with the spiritual sign of the Prophet Muhammad
        (Pbuh), gave the title of Sultanü'l- Ulema (Sultan of scholars) to
        Bahaeddin Veled. After that, Bahaeddin Veled was named with this title.
        The giving of this title can also be explained by the custom of the
        Turks. Turks would not be willing to forget about people with high
        skills and virtues without being recognized. In order to express them in
        the sight of the people, to direct the people to knowledge, they were
        given titles that they deserved. This tradition is a brilliant piece of
        evidence showing Turks' respect for knowledge and virtue. As a matter of
        tradition, they were obliged to use these titles above signatures, and
        they considered these titles a spiritual rank for them. They would never
        be proud of it. Bahaeddin Veled, dressed as scholars, would teach the
        public lessons after the morning prayer. He would chat to his friends
        after the noon prayer. He also preached to the public on Mondays. During
        the Bahaeeddin Veled sermon, he generally rejected the views of those
        who adopted the ideas of Greek philosophers and would say: "How can
        those who forget the heavenly (divine from Allah) books and respect the
        faint words of philosophers get rid of?” Meanwhile, he would speak to
        Fahreddin-i Razi, who taught and defended Greek philosophy, and Kharzem
        shah, who obbeyed him. He considered them as Ahl-i Bid-at (those which
        are not in the time of the prophet, and who generate new traditions
        against religion) and said: "Even better than the walk of Muhammad
        Mustafa (Pbuh), I have not seen a better path than his path.`,

    page: `Fahreddin-i Razi, who does not actually like Sufism and cannot tolerate
        their respect for Kharezm Shah, was also very angry that Bahaeddin Veled
        was openly against himself, and he squandered him to Kharezm Shah. The
        heart of Bahaeddin Veled was hurt from Kharzem Shah and left Belh.
        However, the researchers show the Mongol invasion by causing Bahaeddin
        Veled to emigrate from Belh. Sultanü'l-Ulema intended to go to Hajj
        after leaving the city of Belh with his family members and friends
        between 1212-1213. He stopped by Nishabur. When he approached Baghdad
        with his caravan of immigration, Sultanü'l-Ulema Sheikh Bahaeddin Veled
        gave the following meaningful answer to the guards who asked him which
        tribe they were from and where they came from and where: “We came from
        Allah, we travel to Allah. There is no power in anyone other than
        Allah.” When this word reached Sheikh Şehabettin-i Sühreverdi
        (1145-1235): He said: "Nobody else can say this saying than Belhian
        Bahaeddin Veled." And Sühreverdi ran to meet Bahaeddin Veled with
        sincerity and affection. When they met each other, Sheikh Sühreverdi got
        off his mule and graciously kissed Bahaeddin Veled's knee and offered
        his heartfelt respect. Bahaeddin Veled remained in Baghdad for no more
        than three days and moved to the Kaaba from the way of Kufa. After
        fulfilling his pilgrimage, he came to Damascus on his return. Although
        Bahaeddin Veled was his dear son, Mevlana, he traveled from Damascus to
        Malatya, from there to Erzincan, from there to Karaman. After staying in
        Karaman for a while, they finally chose Konya and settled there.`,

        about the Anatolian people, and with the prayer of Sıddık-i Ekber, these
        people are the most merciful of the whole nation. The best country is
        the Anatolian country; but the people of this country are unaware of the

        Mevlana the way of Allah and shows the truths and secrets in accordance

        from the Sultan of Seljuks, Alâeddîn Keykubat (Reign time 1219-1236). On

        their arrival to the Seljuk's capital city Konya And, together with all
        the important people, he came under his spiritual discipline. Sultan
        Alâeddîn, who was deeply devoted to Sultaü'l-Ulema, expressed his
        admiration to him as follows: "My heart is shaking from his majesty, I'm
        afraid to look at his face. As I see this person, my reality and

        afraid of this man, My God, what kind of a situation is it? I firmly
        believed that he is a rare and unmatched friend of Allah in the world."
        Bahaeddîn Veled, the unique God-friendly and the sultan of the heart,
        who ruled the world sultan, migrated to the eternal realm on Friday,
        February 24, 1231, in the morning. He left a piece full of information
        with a good son like Mohammed Celaleddin. Sultânü'l-Ulema explained only
        his feelings and thoughts and did not pursue fame. He raised those
        around him and always enlightened them.`,

        In the death of Bahaeddîn Veled, Mevlânâ was twenty-four years old. He
        passed to his father's authority because of his father's Bequest, and
        because of his friends and the pleading of all the people. Mevlânâ
        remained without a master for a year after his father until he found
        Seyid Burhaneddin. In 1232, his father's precious caliph, Seyyid
        Burhneddin-i Muhakkık-ı Tirmîzi, came to Konya. Mevlânâ came under his
        spiritual manners. Seyyid Burhaneddin was a very high-grade master. His
        work called Maarif is proof of his wisdom. He was called Sayyid Sır
        (Sultan of Secrets) , because he knows the secrets that are always in
        the hearts. Seyyid Burhaneddin said to Mevlânâ, whom he carried around
        his shoulders like a caregiver in his childhood: "You have no equal in
        knowledge, you are elite. But your father had the spiritual authority,
        so search for it, pass through the words and be a master of heart. You
        have wrapped his words very well, but get drunk with his spirituality
        like me. So you will be the heir to him. Be like the sun in shedding
        light on the world. You are apparently a heir to your father, but I am
        your father's spiritual heir. Look at this friend, and follow me" When
        Mevlana heard these words from his father's caliph, he surrendered
        sincerely to his discipline. Mevlânâ sincerely, put Seyyid Burhaneddin
        in his father's place, and knowing a true master (Murshid), he served
        him for nine years. During this time, with the guidance of that master,
        he struggled with himself (trying hard to defeat the nafs), and became a
        mature person with the help and chat of his master he has been
        transformed like a nur (light). He got rid of himself, became the sultan
        of spirit. As a matter of fact, the following two couplets in Mesnevi
        are the expression that he reached the rank of mature person: "Burn and
        be safe from deterioration / Walk, be light like Burhan-ı Muhakkık /
        When you get rid of yourself / You will be completely Burhan / If you

        travel, entered the period of forty days of worship three times after
        each other, with the wish of his master. In other words, he purified his
        soul three times for forty days (one hundred and twenty days) by
        less-eating, less-drinking, less-sleeping, and spending all of his time
        in worship. At the end of the third spirit purification period, Seyyid
        Burhaneddin hugged and kissed Mevlânâ. He appreciated him and said: "You
        have become an unprecedented person in all sciences and a honored by
        prophets and masters... Say Bismillah (in the name of Allah) and walk
        (advance), fill the people's soul with a fresh life and immeasurable
        mercy. Revive the dead of this world with your own spirit and love."
        Thus, Sayyid Burhaneddin commissioned Mevlana with the guidance. Seyyid
        Burhaneddin then took permission from Mevlana and went to Kayseri and
        migrated there to the eternal realm (1241-1242). His tomb is in Kayseri.
        Mevlânâ, after Seyyid Burhaneddin's departure from Konya, moved to the
        authority of guidance (showing Allah's Way) and teaching. Following his
        father's and grandfather's procedures, he successfully accomplished this

Shams realized that that unfortunate gossip community was again filled with grudge, that love fell from their hearts, that their minds were captive to the devil, and that they were trying to eliminate him.

This time I'm going to go so nobody will know where I am. Everyone will be tired of searching, nobody will even find a trace of me. Thus, many years will pass and nobody will even see me."

    page: `The tomb, called the Green Dome, was built in the time of Çelebi Hüsameddin with the help of Sultan Veled and Alameddin Kayser and the wife of Emir Pervane (daughter of Sultan Gıyaseddin Keyhüsrev II). The architect of the tomb is Bedreddin from Tabriz. An artist named Selimoğlu Abdülvahid built a large walnut coffin, which was accepted as a masterpiece of Seljuk carving, on the tomb of Mevlana. This coffer is on the grave of Sultan-Ulema Bahaeddîn Veled today.`,

    page: `When my coffin start to walk on my death day, don’t think that I have the sadness of this world, and I am leaving the world. Don't be skeptical of this kind, don't cry on me, don't say what a pity. If I fall into the trap of the devil, then it is the time to be dazed. When you see my funeral, do not say separation. Then it is my time to meet. When you put me down in the grave, don't say goodbye; because the tomb is the curtain of the community of heavens. You saw the sunset, watch the rising. What is going to waste before sunset and moon? It appears to sunset to you, but it is to be born. The grave looks like jail, but it is the salvation of life. What seed was sown in the ground and did not bear fruit? Why do you doubt the human seed? Which bucket was sent to the well and did not come full of water? Why should Yusuf (Prophet) cry out in the well?When you closed your mouth in this world, open it in the other world. Because your efforts are in the heavens of the skies."`,
